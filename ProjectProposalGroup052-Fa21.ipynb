    "### Summary\n",
    "This article from Turkey is a discussion and analysis of crime in the urban world, with the aim of helping inform future\n",
    " urban planning so as to avoid the facilitation of crime. Specifically, they suggest that urban crime due to the density\n",
    " of money in urban areas, the ease of escape, and the high proportion of people to law enforcement. They also suggest\n",
    "that places which are particularly prone to crime are chaotic/dense places, city/commerce centers, and places with\n",
    "few/no behavioral rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "- Density of Police could be a key feature to analyze\n",
    "- City Centers could be an additional feature to analyze\n",
    "- Certain types of crime may have creased during COVID-19 due to reduced crowding?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Waitz Library Traffic Project\n",
    "Our project focuses on analyzing past crime rates that have taken place throughout San Diego and the different factors that\n",
    "might come into effect when crimes are committed. These factors include crime, income, population density, weather and\n",
    "temperature, and the number of police stations located in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reviewing previous COGS 108 final projects our group found a project called Waitz Library Traffic that includes a\n",
    "similar approach we hope to implement in our own project. The Waitz Library Traffic project’s main idea was to predict the\n",
    "traffic in UCSD’s libraries using various types of data including weather, classes schedules, shuttles, and traffic. After\n",
    "reviewing this project we have learned that it’s best to gather at least three various types of data in order to form a strong\n",
    "conclusion as well as to make sure our data collected is valid and within the same time period in order to ensure a strong\n",
    "dataset. With the information gathered after reviewing the Waitz Library Traffic project our group will be implementing the\n",
    "collection of five different datasets within the same time period as well as examining our data gathered to ensure its validity"

    "### Crime Dataset\n",
    "For our ideal crime dataset, data would be collected by police departments upon an official arrest. Our ideal crime\n",
    "dataset would take the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dates | Times | City District | Crime Type |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ---------- |\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not interested in analyzing demographics in this study due to their complex nature in relation to statistics,\n",
    "and for ethical reasons.\n",

    "### Income\n",
    "Our ideal income dataset be recorded by the IRS via taxes. Although this method wil fail to capture 'unofficial' income,\n",
    "we expect this to be a relatively minor issue for our purposes. Our ideal income dataset would take the following form:\n",

    "| City | District | Annual Income |\n",
    "| ---- | -------- | ------------- |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population Density\n",
    "Our ideal population density dataset would be recorded via the US Government. This would potentially exclude unofficial\n",

    "following form:\n",

    "| City | District | Density |\n",
    "| ---- | -------- | ------- |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather and Temperature\n",
    "Our ideal weather/temperature dataset would be recorded via the National Weather Service. This would be actual recorded\n",
    "weather, and not predictions. Our ideal weather/temperature dataset would take the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City | District | Weather Type | Temperature |\n",
    "| ---- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Police Stations\n",
    "Our ideal police stations dataset would be recorded via the state of San Diego. If the number of police stations are not\n",

    "In this project, some of our data (namely the crime reports) contains very personal information which could be used to\n",

    "datasets and results will be analyzed and visualized fairly and would not be manipulated to get a desired outcome.\n",

    "crime, that this is because one causes the other, nor that they are even correlated at all. To help account for this,\n",
    "we plan to use only part of our data for training, and another part for testing if our predictions stand."
